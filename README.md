# discord-manager
This project allows to view bot statistics from your web browser.

## How?
Git clone this repository, then run this to retrieve the submodules from hydrabolt and mustache.js

### https
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/moustacheminer/discord-manager.git`

### ssh
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:moustacheminer/discord-manager.git`

You will need a SSH key to do this. Alternatively, download the zip from all repositories, and place files where they belong.

Then open `index.html`

If it complains, try emptying cache and hard reloading. You can do this in Google Chrome and Chromium by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+I`, then right clicking the refresh button, then select `empty cache and hard reload`.  
Please and only then complain after doing this.

## Features

### Curse Purge Plus
Purge yourself from unwanted servers!

Select from percentage of bots in a group and minimum bots to get rid of yourself from pesky "bot" collection groups, in as simple as 11 clicks!

### Basic Info
This info is so basic, you've probably already implemented it.

If you haven't, it can:

- Display all real users and bots
- Display number of users, and bots
- Display number of guilds

- Display users and bots in each guild
- View each guild's beautiful icon
